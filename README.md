# Personalised Wedding React Project

This is a standalone frontend-only React + Vite project.

## Theme
- Keeps the same romantic media context (video + music)
- Reframed from Valentine's messaging to a wedding announcement
- Uses random bride/groom names per load
- Wedding date is hardcoded to **March 15, 2026**

## Run
From `personalised-react-project`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes
- Media is local in `public/videos` and `public/music`.
- No backend/API connections are used.
